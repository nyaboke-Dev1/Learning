    <h1>EUNICE NYABOKE</h1>
    <p>My name is <b>Eunice Nyaboke Onkundi</b>. I’m a passionate and curious computer science student at JKUAT, with a strong interest in front-end development, UI/UX design, and solving real-world problems through technology.<br> I’ve actively <i>contributed to projects that enhance user experience and accessibility, including a student industrial attachment tracking platform</i>. <br>
        <em>I enjoy learning by doing</em>, and I’m continuously exploring areas like <u>full-stack development, cybersecurity</u>, and <s>data science</s>. Outside of academics, I’m also entrepreneurial, with hands-on experience running a small food business.<br> I value ethical tech, inclusivity, and using my skills to make a positive impact.</p>
