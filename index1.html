    <!--This is a paragraph that describes who I am-->
    <p>I’m a passionate and curious computer science student at JKUAT, with a strong interest in front-end development, UI/UX design, and solving real-world problems through technology.<br> I’ve actively contributed to projects that enhance user experience and accessibility, including a student industrial attachment tracking platform. <br>
        I enjoy learning by doing, and I’m continuously exploring areas like full-stack development, cybersecurity, and data science. Outside of academics, I’m also entrepreneurial, with hands-on experience running a small food business.<br> I value ethical tech, inclusivity, and using my skills to make a positive impact.
